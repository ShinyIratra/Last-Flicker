## Road to Finish !

**What should we add next ?** 
Before adding more complex things, i want to add some basic mechanics :
- Perks 
- Better UX
- More maps
- A P2P Multiplayer

## F.A.Q

**Why?**  
- There are many reasons for this. First, I’ve had a low-spec PC for most of my life, and almost every new game released today suffers from poor optimization.  
- I want a fully open-source alternative to COD Zombies that provides more freedom for custom maps.

**How to contribute?**  
1. Fork this repository via the **Fork** button (top-right).  
2. Clone your fork locally:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShinyIratra/Last-Flicker.git
   ```  
3. Open Godot 3.5 (Mono), click **Import**, and select `Last-Flicker.sln`.  
4. Create a feature branch:  
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/awesome-idea
   ```  
5. Commit your changes, push, and open a Pull Request for review.

**Why Godot & C#?**  
- Why not? Godot is lightweight, cross-platform, and perfect for rapid 2D/3D development.  
- The base code was already written in C#, so sticking with Mono ensures consistency.

**Will it always be open-source?**  
Absolutely. I’m committed to keeping Last Flicker 100% open-source and continuously updating it to fulfill my dream of creating a polished, community-driven game.

**Misc**
This is my very first public game project. So I may make some mistakes,
but I will try my best.
